# Ginger Tool
"It's basically bash making itself worse

The result is Ginger Tool

It isn't a tool

It isn't a shell

It's just a time waste playground so if you want to waste time and computer space Ginger Tool is perfect


Want to do something with the wasted space?

Use 'say' command

You'll see 'say...' in the screen

Then type whatever you want and it'll repeat it

Still not fun, no?

Type the 'log' command

You'll see 3 commands you executed before

This command doesn't count

You can clear the screen using 'cl'

This is it for now

Goodbye"

So this description totally not taken and modified from the expl command tells you about what it is


Use he if you want the commands and what they do

Fullscreen was planned, but i failed to implement it because of my dumbness


No download files for now, just cloning the repository

# How to run it?
This is the easiest part

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anotherGingerBrave/Ginger-Tool.git
bash ~/Ginger-Tool/gingertool.bash
```

I was worried with possible misinformation before, but don't worry, i tested it, and it's working
